Notes/Comments on Schematic:

(Ben's Review)
- names are visible on all devices
- generally organized and neat schematic with no wires crossing
- all the power pins are connected to the correct power pins (3V and V_Batt)

Notes/Comments on Devices, Symbol, and Packages

(Alex's Review)
- All of the packages have a bounding box in tKeepout
- All of the packages include a part outline in tPlace
- position(x) of the side pads for the imu may be slightly off.
- position(y) of the of the upper and lower pads
- the pads for the yellow LED are currently 0.8 mm apart, should be 0.7 mm.
- the pads for the yellow LED are also not extended by 1mm (optional)
- both available on digikey as single-order items
- the pad size should be 1.25 x (1mm +0.35mm) instead of 1.25mm x 1mm

(Ben's Review)
- extend resistor pads 1mm beyond side of package
- extend cap pads 1mm beyond side of package
- duplicate name layer on capacitor 
- IMU missing 45 deg indentation to show orientation (not sure if needed)
- packages and devices are properly connected to the right pins
- symbols are properly labeled and on proper grid size (0.1")
