1. Rx0, PB6, PB7, SDA, N6, RESET, SDA, SCL, PWM3 routed through internal layers. Not sure if its really a problem or not
2. Several clearance issues show up in DRC
3. Mosi trace under the imu
4. FTDI silkscreen name goes off of the board
5. J1 and some other names over their go off the board
6. There is a stray 3V wire on the board, look at -9.4488, -5.1816
7. Non 45 degree increment wire, look at the SDA trace at 8.47,-29.05
8. Non 45 degree increment wire, look at the SCL trace at 5.93, -29.05
9. Some parts of your 3V and GND pour look a bit too thin, needs to be at least 5mm in width at any point, check left of the antenna and        below the crystal
10. I believe you need to place a dimension for the structure that holds your motors, though I did measure the “arms” to be thick enough.
11. Your capacitors for the antenna may be a too far? Check the schematic red board for reference, it looks like they placed their capacitor     very close to, and had their wires connected almost directly to the balun
12. Messy/ stray SDA wires around -6.096, 10.8204
