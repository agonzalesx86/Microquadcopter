Ben’s Review/Comments:


Part Placement:
- Design fits within a 19,345 mm2 box
- Reset and power jumpers are far enough from propeller
- Battery near center and IMU is center of axis of quadcopter
- FTDI Headers are not along the side of board, hard to see labels/names
- Microcontroller is close to antenna, which is close to edge of board
Logo:
*** Did not see a logo
Antenna and Antenna Driver:
- Traces are on layer 1 (top)
- Traces between Antenna and Balun are extra thick
- The two capacitors are close to the Balun
- Trace between balun and antenna is short
- The Ground pours are on the proper layer surrounding the antenna and its components
- The vias are connected to gnd
- Both pads are surrounded by pours
- All traces in antenna and drivers are relevant to components there
Power and Ground:
- Power plane does reach under all 4 motor drivers
- Vbat power plane is at least 0.5mm everywhere
- 3V power plane reaches the microcontroller and imu
- GND and VBAT planes extends everywhere and are of the same layer (layer 2)
*** Voltage Regulator is not over VBAT plane
IMU:
- IMU is at center of board
- Caps are of reasonable distance to IMU
- Orientation of IMU corresponds with Pitch (X) and Roll (Y)
- No traces under IMU center and only ground plane is under IMU
Headers:
- FTDI silkscreen labels are on board
Microcontroller:
- Resonator traces do lie in top plane
- Cap and resonator layout is similar to redboard
- Decoupling caps are reasonable distance to microcontroller
Power Supply: 
- Caps are near voltage regulator 

Motor Driver:
- Traces are thick enough to handle large current


Mechanical: 
- Board is most symmetric
- Diameter of motor holders are about 8.4mm
- No stray holes in board
- Accounted for propeller size and accounted for proper clearance
Aesthetic: 
- Board is mostly neat and tidy
